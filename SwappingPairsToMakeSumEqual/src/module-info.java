 *
 *         Given two arrays of integers A[] and B[] of size N and M, the task is
 *         to check if a pair of values (one value from each array) exists such
 *         that swapping the elements of the pair will make the sum of two
 *         arrays equal.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *         Example 1:
 * 
 *         Input: N = 6, M = 4 A[] = {4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2} B[] = (3, 6, 3, 3)
 *         Output: 1 Explanation: Sum of elements in A[] = 11 Sum of elements in
 *         B[] = 15, To get same sum from both arrays, we can swap following
 *         values: 1 from A[] and 3 from B[] Example 2:
 * 
 *         Input: N = 4, M = 4 A[] = {5, 7, 4, 6} B[] = {1, 2, 3, 8} Output: 1
 *         Explanation: We can swap 6 from array A[] and 2 from array B[]
